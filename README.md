# IoT-Kits-Firmware
This is a set of firmware sketches for the **IoT KitsÂ©** solar-powered, wireless weather stations. They will work with either the single-board or stacked kits available from [W4KRL.com/IoT-Kits](https://w4krl.com/iot-kits/).

There are five active sketches. Two MQTT sketches are under development:
1. **D1M-WX1_Calibration** - Use this to verify your Arduino/ESP8266 software and to calibrate the analog-to-digital converter in the weather station
2. **D1M-WX1_IoT_REST** - Posts data to ThingSpeak Internet of Things (IoT) service using the REST API
3. **D1M-WX1_APRS_REST** - Posts data to APRS-IS and to ThingSpeak using REST [**NOTE:** For licensed amateur radio operators only.]
4. **D1S-Display-APRS_manual_config** - Displays weather station data from your APRS-IS feed. Uses manual configuration rather than WiFiManager config.
5. **D1S-Display-IoT_manual_config** - This is a preview release. It is working and safe to use but some planned features are not yet working. It displays weather station data from your ThingSpeak channel. Uses manual configuration rather than WiFiManager config.
- D1M-WX1_IoT_MQTT - *IN DEVELOPMENT* - Posts data to ThingSpeak using MQTT
- D1M-WX1_APRS_MQTT - *IN DEVELOPMENT* - Posts data to APRS and to ThingSpeak using MQTT

## Installation
1. Click on the **Clone or download** button and select Download ZIP. The file will download as **IoT-Kits-Firmware-master.zip**. 
2. Unzip the file. Copy each of the folders within IoT-Kits-Firmware-master to your Arduino folder.
3. The sketches are provided with important library files in subfolders to ensure having a consistent software package. Comments within the sketches identify the library authors, version level, and source.

## Configuration of ThingSpeak_config.h
All weather station sketches need a ThingSpeak_config.h file. It must be located in the same folder as the sketch XXX.ino file.

Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE. Select the ThingSpeak_config.h tab and edit the information for your station as indicated by the comments within the file. 

Information needed:
- Your WiFi SSID (You must use 2.4 GHz not 5 GHz.)
- Your WiFi password
- Station elevation in meters. You can get this at [www.freemaptools.com](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm)
- Sleep interval in seconds: 60 for testing, 600 for normal service
- ThingSpeak channel ID (a numerical value)
- ThingSpeak API Write Key (alphanumeric between quotes)
- OPTIONAL (Values determined from running D1M-WX1_Calibration.ino)
  - DMM voltage
  - ADC reading

Save the sketch.

## Configuration of APRS_config.h
Only sketches using APRS need an APRS_config.h file. You must have a valid amateur radio license to use APRS.

Information needed:
- Find your location at [www.distancesto.com/](https://www.distancesto.com/coordinates.php)
  - latitude (decimal degrees, positive for north, negative for south)
  - longitude (decimal degrees, positive for east, negative for west)
- CALLSIGN-SSID
- APRS passcode

Save the sketch.
