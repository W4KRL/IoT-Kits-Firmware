# IoT-Kits-Firmware
This is a set of firmware sketches for the **IoT KitsÂ©** solar-powered, wireless weather stations. They will work with either the single-board or stacked kits available from [W4KRL.com/IoT-Kits](https://w4krl.com/iot-kits/).

There are five active sketches:
1. **D1M-WX1-Calibration** - Use this to verify that you have installed the ESP8266 core in the Arduino IDE. It can also calibrate the analog-to-digital converter in the weather station.
2. **D1M-WX1-IoT-REST** - Posts data to ThingSpeak Internet of Things (IoT) service using the REST API.
3. **D1M-WX1-APRS-REST** - Posts data to APRS-IS and to ThingSpeak using REST [**NOTE:** For licensed amateur radio operators only.]
4. **D1S-Display-APRS-manual-config** - Displays weather station data from your APRS-IS feed. Uses manual configuration rather than WiFiManager config.
5. **D1S-Display-IoT-manual-config** - This displays weather station data from your ThingSpeak channel and uses manual configuration rather than WiFiManager config.

**NOTE:** *The remote displays originally used a captive web page to configure the kit. A recent change to one of the third-party libraries broke that capability. The comptibility issue has been resolved and new firmware is in design to restore the feature.*

## Installation
1. Click on the **Clone or download** button and select Download ZIP. The file will download as **IoT-Kits-Firmware-master.zip**. 
2. Unzip the file. Copy each of the folders within IoT-Kits-Firmware-master to your Arduino folder.
3. The sketches are provided with important library files in subfolders to ensure having a consistent software package. Comments within the sketches identify the library authors, version levels, and sources.

## Configuration of ThingSpeak_config.h
All weather station sketches need a ThingSpeak_config.h file. It must be located in the same folder as the sketch XXX.ino file.

Open the sketch in the Arduino IDE. Select the ThingSpeak_config.h or appropriet tab and edit the information for your station as indicated by the comments within the file. 

### Information needed:
- Your WiFi SSID **(You must use 2.4 GHz not 5 GHz.)**
- Your WiFi password
- Station elevation in meters. You can get this at [www.freemaptools.com](https://www.freemaptools.com/elevation-finder.htm)
- Sleep interval in seconds: 60 for testing, 600 or longer for normal service
- ThingSpeak channel ID (a numerical value)
- ThingSpeak API Write Key (alphanumeric between quotes)
- For the remote display kits, you must select the appropriate timezone by uncommenting your location.
- OPTIONAL (Values determined from running D1M-WX1_Calibration.ino)
  - DMM voltage
  - ADC reading

Save the sketch. Set the **PROG/RUN** switch to PROG and upload to the microcontroller. **Return the switch to RUN after a sucessful upload.**

## Configuration of APRS_config.h
Only sketches using APRS need an APRS_config.h file. You must have a valid amateur radio license to use APRS.

### Information needed:
- Find your location at [www.distancesto.com/](https://www.distancesto.com/coordinates.php)
  - latitude (decimal degrees, positive for north, negative for south)
  - longitude (decimal degrees, positive for east, negative for west)
- CALLSIGN-SSID
- APRS passcode
- For the remote display kits, you must select the appropriate timezone by uncommenting your location.

Save the sketch. Set the **PROG/RUN** switch to PROG and upload to the microcontroller. **Return the switch to RUN after a sucessful upload.**
