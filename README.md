# IoT_Kits_Distribution
This is a set of firmware sketches for the **IoT KitsÂ©** solar-powered, wireless weather stations. They will work with either the single-board or stacked kits available from [https://W4KRL.com/IoT-Kits](https://w4krl.com/iot-kits/).

There are four sketches for now. Two MQTT sketches are under development:
- **D1M-WX1_Calibration** - Calibrates the analog-to-digital converter
- **D1M-WX1_IoT_REST** - Posts data to ThingSpeak using the REST API
- **D1M-WX1_APRS_REST** - Posts data to ThingSpeak using the REST and to APRS
- **D1S-IoT-Remote-Display** - Sketch under development to read & display ThngSpeak feed
- D1M-WX1_IoT_MQTT - TO BE DEVELOPED Posts data to ThingSpeak using MQTT
- D1M-WX1_APRS_MQTT - TO BE DEVELOPED Posts data to ThingSpeak using MQTT and to APRS

This version posts weather data and telemetry to [ThingSpeak](http://www.thingspeak.com) using the REST API. Firmware that adds APRS connectivity is D1M-WX1_APRS_REST.
